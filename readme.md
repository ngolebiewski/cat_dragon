# Cat Dragon

Last minute attempt to make a mobile/web game that is less than 13k bytes in size! 

2025 Theme: black cat

Make a JRPG (Japanese Role Playing Game) adventure with Turn-Based combat -> Is it possible to fit it all into a 13k it file?t

Approach: 
- No Libraries, just browser APIs (i.e. Canvas, AudioContext).
- 5 minute and 1 regular search rule before referencing AI.
